# Rule: Keep start_local.bat in sync with project changes

[Always]
When modifying backend or frontend startup logic, update the `start_local.bat` file 
to ensure the project can still be launched with one click.  
- The backend must run on `127.0.0.1:%BACKEND_PORT%` (default 8000).  
- The frontend must start with the correct npm/yarn command.  
- Activate the correct Python virtual environment before backend launch.  
- Print clear `[INFO]` messages in the console for each major step.  
- Kill any process blocking the backend port before starting it.  

[Auto Attached]
Files:
- start_local.bat
- pyproject.toml
- package.json
- llm-context.md

Behavior:
- Whenever `pyproject.toml` or `package.json` is changed, check if `start_local.bat` needs updates.
- Ensure the script reflects any new dependencies, entry points, or port changes.

[Agent Requested]
If asked to fix startup errors, always propose an update to `start_local.bat` in addition to code changes.
